👋 **Oh, hi! You found my corner of the internet.**

I’m <span style="color:var(--accent-primary)"><strong>Satyajit Roy</strong></span>, but you can call me <span style="color:var(--accent-secondary)"><strong>Roy</strong></span>. (It saves syllables for more important things, like variable naming debates).

I am a **Technologist**, **Problem-Solver**, and **Chief Automation Officer** of my own life. My philosophy is simple: **"If I have to do it twice, I’m writing a script. If I have to do it thrice, I’m building a platform."**

### 🦖 The Origin Story (20+ Years of "It Works on My Machine")

I’ve been in the game long enough to remember when "The Cloud" was just something that ruined your picnic. From the dark ages of `Solaris Zones` and `LXC` to the shiny, chaotic world of `Kubernetes` and **Cloud-Native** everything—I’ve seen tech hypes rise, fall, and get rebranded.

I specialize in building high-performing **SRE**, **DevOps**, and **Platform Security** teams. Essentially, my job is to help companies build systems that **don't** wake everyone up at 3 AM on a Saturday.

### 🤖 The AI/ML "Magic" (Scaling Brains)

When I'm not wrestling with YAML, I'm usually building the heavy-duty plumbing for AI. I’ve architected platforms processing **30B+ daily requests** (yes, with a 'B') and built massive **NVIDIA GPU clusters** that are probably smarter than me. 

If you need to know about **GPU-aware scheduling**, **MLOps** (Kubeflow/MLflow), or how to stop your inference costs from reaching Mars, I’m your guy. I turn "The model is slow" into "The infrastructure is blazing."

### 🛠️ What I Actually Do:

*   ⚙️ **Engineering & Architecture**: Drawing boxes and arrows that eventually become expensive, resilient infrastructure.
*   ☁️ **Cloud & AI Scale**: Turning "It works in dev" into "It scales to 30 Billion requests" without the CFO having a heart attack.
*   🏎️ **HPC & GPU Tuning**: Squeezing every last drop of performance out of A100s and H100s using RDMA and InfiniBand.
*   🔐 **Security-First Thinking**: Because "admin/admin" is still not a valid security strategy, even in the age of AI.
*   🚀 **Team Building**: Hiring smart people and then trying hard not to get in their way.

### 🧠 Why This Blog Exists

This site is my **Engineering Therapy**. It’s where I dump my thoughts, tutorials, rants, and the occasional "Aha!" moment. It serves two main purposes:
  1. Helping you solve that obscure error message you found on Google.
  2. Reminding future me how I fixed that obscure error message 6 months ago.

Thanks for stopping by. If you see me in a data center, a Slack thread, or debugging NVIDIA drivers, say hi!
