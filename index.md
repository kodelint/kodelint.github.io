## 👋 Hello there, internet traveler!

I’m <span class="highlight-orange">Satyajit Roy</span> — but most people just call me <span class="highlight-orange">Roy</span>.
I'm a technologist, problem-solver, and part-time automation evangelist.
_Motto: If I have to do it more than once — I automate it._

Over the past **20+ years**, I’ve built high-performing Product Development, SRE, DevOps, and Platform Security teams
at both scrappy startups and global enterprises.

I’ve worked with everything from `Solaris Zones` and `LXE` to **Kubernetes** and cloud-native platforms.
I've seen plenty of tech hype cycles, and I've built systems that actually last through them.

### 🛠️ What I do

- ⚙️ Software Engineering & Infrastructure Architecture
- ☁️ Cloud-Scale Platform Delivery
- 🔐 Security-First Thinking
- 🚀 Building no-nonsense, high-output teams

This site is where I write about engineering lessons learned (sometimes painfully),
share ideas, and reflect on modern infrastructure and team culture.
Call it a digital lab notebook for the curious and caffeinated.

Thanks for stopping by — maybe we’ll meet in a Slack thread, a postmortem, or somewhere unexpected.

**💡 A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.** <span class="highlight-orange">That’s me!</span>
