I am <span style="color: orange">**Satyajit Roy**</span>, I usually go by <span style="color: orange">**Roy**</span>. I am absolutely obsessed with <span style="color: white">technology</span> and passionate about solving complex problems. Been in the industry for long enough to realize that I might have some experience to share with the community. That is why this website exist. During my tenure I was able to learn from, contribute in many domains. Some of them are being <span style="color: white">Software Development</span>, <span style="color: white">Architecting Infrastructure</span>, <span style="color: white">Managing and Maintaining highly scalable environments</span> and spent whole lot of time in <span style="color: white">**DevOps/SRE Domain**</span>, <span style="color: white">**building highly efficient, tech savvy teams**</span>. I live by one motto if I need to do something more than once then it has to be Automated!! Pretty much leveraged all sorts of technology and tools in my day to day life. Love to write code and design complex systems. Started from `Solaris Zones` and `LXE` to `Docker` and `K8S`, pretty much seen all sorts of technological hypes and fades. 

**Hopfully, we will cross path someday......see you out there and thanks for visiting the site.**
