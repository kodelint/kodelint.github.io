👋 **Oh, hi! You found my corner of the internet.**

I’m <span style="color:var(--accent-primary)"><strong>Satyajit Roy</strong></span>, but you can call me <span style="color:var(--accent-secondary)"><strong>Roy</strong></span>. (It saves syllables for more important things, like variable naming debates).

I am a **Technologist**, **Problem-Solver**, and **Chief Automation Officer** of my own life. My philosophy is simple: <span style="color: var(--accent-tertiary)">_"If I have to do it twice, I’m writing a script. If I have to do it thrice, I’m building a platform."_</span>

### 🦖 The Origin Story (20+ Years of "It Works on My Machine")

I’ve been in the game long enough to remember when "The Cloud" was just something that ruined your picnic. I’ve journeyed from the dark ages of <span class="tooltip-container">`Solaris Zones`<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Ancient Magic [ancient]</b>Hard partitions from a time when servers were the size of refrigerators and 'uptime' was measured in years, not pod restarts.</span></span> and <span class="tooltip-container">`LXC`<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Docker's Granddad [history]</b>The bridge between 'it's a VM' and 'it's a container'. Mostly used today by people who actually understand how Linux namespaces work.</span></span> through the shiny, chaotic world of <span class="tooltip-container">`Kubernetes`<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Kubernetes [man]</b>The orchestrator of everything. YAML monsters and Pod herding included.</span></span>, and now into the era of babysitting massive <span class="tooltip-container">**NVIDIA GPU clusters**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Money Pit [noun]</b>A hole in the ground where you throw venture capital in exchange for heat and slightly faster matrix multiplication.</span></span>.

Basically, I’ve spent two decades watching tech hypes rise, fall, and get rebranded while building high-performing <span class="tooltip-container">**SRE**, **DevOps**, and **Platform Security**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>The Holy Trinity [myth]</b>Three distinct roles that managers think can be filled by one person with "passion" and "grit".</span></span> teams. These days, when I'm not wrestling with <span class="tooltip-container">`YAML`<span class="tooltip-box"><b>YAML [man]</b>Yet Another Markup Language. Or as I call it: Indentation-induced Engineering Therapy.</span></span>, I'm the <span class="tooltip-container">**AI Plumber**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Mario for Models [job]</b>I don't rescue princesses; I unclog data pipes and make sure the tensors flow in the right direction.</span></span>—making the hardware sweat so the models don't have to. I specialize in squeezing every last drop of performance out of GPUs until the data center smells slightly like ozone and your inference costs stop orbiting Saturn.

My goal has always been the same: building systems that are smart enough to scale and stable enough to <span class="tooltip-container">**not**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>The Dream [concept]</b>A theoretical state of existence where my pager doesn't sound like a dubstep concert at 3 AM.</span></span> wake everyone up at 3 AM on a Saturday.

### 🛠️ What I Actually Do:

- ⚙️ **Engineering & Architecture**: Drawing boxes and arrows that eventually become expensive, resilient infrastructure.
- ☁️ **Cloud & AI Scale**: Turning <span class="tooltip-container">"It works in dev"<span class="tooltip-box"><b>The Great Lie [phrase]</b>A contractual disclaimer meaning "It ran on my MacBook once, so good luck with your Linux kernel version."</span></span> into <span class="tooltip-container">"It works for everyone"<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Utopia [fiction]</b>A mythical land where dependencies match, versions align, and users read documentation.</span></span> without the CFO having a heart attack.
- 🏎️ **HPC & GPU Tuning**: Squeezing performance out of hardware using <span class="tooltip-container">**RDMA**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Speed Demon [tech]</b>Skipping the CPU like it's a slow middle manager. Direct memory access for the impatient.</span></span>, <span class="tooltip-container">**InfiniBand**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>The Fast Lane [tech]</b>Networking so fast it makes Ethernet look like a carrier pigeon with a broken wing. Expensive, temperamental, and absolutely glorious.</span></span>, and sheer willpower.
- 🔐 **Security-First Thinking**: Because <span class="tooltip-container">"admin/admin"<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Security Through Laziness [strategy]</b>If the password is easy to guess, maybe the hackers will think it's a trap and leave.</span></span> is still not a valid security strategy, even in the age of AI.
- 🚀 **Team Building**: Hiring smart people and then trying hard not to get in their way.

### 🧠 Why This Blog Exists

This site is my <span class="tooltip-container">**Engineering Therapy**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Screaming into the Void [activity]</b>Cheaper than a therapist, but with more YAML syntax errors.</span></span>. It’s where I document my battles with distributed systems and "HPC magic" before they get lost in the sea of browser tabs I never close. It serves a few noble purposes:

1.  **Public Service**: Helping you solve that obscure, soul-crushing error message you found on Google at 2 AM. If I can save one person from a <span class="tooltip-container">**Segfault**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Memory Amnesia [error]</b>The program tried to touch a memory it didn't own. It's like walking into a stranger's house and getting kicked out immediately.</span></span> or a <span class="tooltip-container">**Deadlock**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Mexican Standoff [state]</b>Thread A wants Resource B. Thread B wants Resource A. They both die waiting. Tragic.</span></span>, I’ve done my job.
2.  **External Brain**: Reminding future me how I fixed that exact same "impossible" bug 6 months ago. Let's be honest, if the compiler didn't catch it and I didn't blog it, it never happened.
3.  **Typed Sanity**: A safe space to celebrate the joy of <span class="tooltip-container">**Golang**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Gopher Power [lang]</b>Google's way of saying "I trust you with concurrency, but not with generics (initially)."</span></span> binaries and my ongoing struggle to satisfy the <span class="tooltip-container">**Rust**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>The Borrower [lang]</b>It treats you like a toddler with scissors. "No! You can't have mutable access!"</span></span> borrow checker. You won't find any interpreted chaos here—just pure, statically-linked systems-level sanity.
4.  **Distributed Venting**: Because sometimes you just need to rant about why your cluster state is currently a dumpster fire or why <span class="tooltip-container">**RDMA**<span class="tooltip-box"><b>Speed Demon [tech]</b>Skipping the CPU like it's a slow middle manager. Direct memory access for the impatient.</span></span> is acting like it's 1995.

Thanks for stopping by. If you see me in a data center, a Slack thread, or wrestling with a borrow checker, say hi!
