👋 **Hello there, internet traveler!**

I’m <span style="color:var(--accent-primary)"><strong>Satyajit Roy</strong></span> — but most people just call me <span style="color:var(--accent-secondary)"><strong>Roy</strong></span>. I'm a technologist, problem-solver, and part-time automation evangelist (my motto: if I have to do it twice, it gets automated).

Over the past 20+ years, I’ve had the privilege (and sometimes the headache) of building high-performing Product Development, SRE, DevOps, and Platform Security teams across fast-moving startups and global enterprises. I’ve navigated everything from `Solaris Zones` and `LXE` to `Kubernetes` and **cloud-native** everything. Basically, I’ve seen enough tech hypes rise and fall to earn a few gray hairs and a solid sense of when something’s actually useful.

### My work has taken me deep into:

*   ⚙️ Software Engineering & Infrastructure Architecture
*   ☁️ Cloud-Scale Platform Delivery
*   🔐 Security-First Thinking
*   🚀 Building tech-savvy, no-BS teams that get stuff done

I’m passionate about sharing what I’ve learned (often the hard way), whether it's through stories, strategies, or sharp opinions on systems design and modern engineering culture.

This site is where I collect those thoughts, ideas, rants, and (sometimes) helpful insights — think of it as part technical diary, part engineering therapy.

Thanks for stopping by. Hope we cross paths someday — in a data center, Slack thread, or somewhere entirely unexpected.
