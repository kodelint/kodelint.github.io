👋 **Oh, hi! You found my corner of the internet.**

I’m <span style="color:var(--accent-primary)"><strong>Satyajit Roy</strong></span>, but you can call me <span style="color:var(--accent-secondary)"><strong>Roy</strong></span>. (It saves syllables for more important things, like variable naming debates).

I am a **Technologist**, **Problem-Solver**, and **Chief Automation Officer** of my own life. My philosophy is simple: **"If I have to do it twice, I’m writing a script. If I have to do it thrice, I’m building a platform."**

### 🦖 The Origin Story (20+ Years of "It Works on My Machine")

I’ve been in the game long enough to remember when "The Cloud" was just something that ruined your picnic. From the dark ages of `Solaris Zones` and `LXC` to the shiny, chaotic world of `Kubernetes` and **Cloud-Native** everything—I’ve seen tech hypes rise, fall, and get rebranded.

I specialize in building high-performing **SRE**, **DevOps**, and **Platform Security** teams across fast-moving startups and global enterprises. Essentially, my job is to help companies build systems that **don't** wake everyone up at 3 AM on a Saturday.

### 🛠️ What I Actually Do:

*   ⚙️ **Engineering & Architecture**: Drawing boxes and arrows that eventually become expensive, resilient infrastructure.
*   ☁️ **Cloud Delivery**: Turning "It works in dev" into "It scales in prod" without burning down the budget.
*   🔐 **Security-First Thinking**: Because "admin/admin" is not a valid security strategy.
*   🚀 **Team Building**: Hiring smart people and then trying hard not to get in my way.

### 🧠 Why This Blog Exists

This site is my **Engineering Therapy**. It’s where I dump my thoughts, tutorials, rants, and the occasional "Aha!" moment. It serves two main purposes:
  1. Helping you solve that obscure error message you found on Google.
  2. Reminding future me how I fixed that obscure error message 6 months ago.

Thanks for stopping by. If you see me in a data center, a Slack thread, or debugging YAML files, say hi!
