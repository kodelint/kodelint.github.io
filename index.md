👋 **Oh, hi! You found my corner of the internet.**

I’m <span style="color:var(--accent-primary)"><strong>Satyajit Roy</strong></span>, but you can call me <span style="color:var(--accent-secondary)"><strong>Roy</strong></span>. (It saves syllables for more important things, like variable naming debates).

I am a **Technologist**, **Problem-Solver**, and **Chief Automation Officer** of my own life. My philosophy is simple: **"If I have to do it twice, I’m writing a script. If I have to do it thrice, I’m building a platform."**

### 🦖 The Origin Story (20+ Years of "It Works on My Machine")

I’ve been in the game long enough to remember when "The Cloud" was just something that ruined your picnic. I’ve journeyed from the dark ages of `Solaris Zones` and `LXC` through the shiny, chaotic world of `Kubernetes`, and now into the era of babysitting massive **NVIDIA GPU clusters**. 

Basically, I’ve spent two decades watching tech hypes rise, fall, and get rebranded while building high-performing **SRE**, **DevOps**, and **Platform Security** teams. These days, when I'm not wrestling with YAML, I'm the **AI Plumber**—making the hardware sweat so the models don't have to. I specialize in squeezing every last drop of performance out of GPUs until the data center smells slightly like ozone and your inference costs stop orbiting Saturn. 

My goal has always been the same: building systems that are smart enough to scale and stable enough to **not** wake everyone up at 3 AM on a Saturday.

### 🛠️ What I Actually Do:

*   ⚙️ **Engineering & Architecture**: Drawing boxes and arrows that eventually become expensive, resilient infrastructure.
*   ☁️ **Cloud & AI Scale**: Turning "It works in dev" into "It works for everyone" without the CFO having a heart attack.
*   🏎️ **HPC & GPU Tuning**: Squeezing performance out of hardware using RDMA, InfiniBand, and sheer willpower.
*   🔐 **Security-First Thinking**: Because "admin/admin" is still not a valid security strategy, even in the age of AI.
*   🚀 **Team Building**: Hiring smart people and then trying hard not to get in their way.

### 🧠 Why This Blog Exists

This site is essentially my **Engineering Therapy**. It’s where I dump my thoughts, tutorials, and the occasional "Aha!" moment before they get lost in the sea of browser tabs I never close. It serves a few noble purposes:

1.  **Public Service**: Helping you solve that obscure, life-ruining error message you found on Google at 2 AM.
2.  **External Brain**: Reminding future me how I fixed that exact same obscure error message 6 months ago (because let’s be honest, I’ve already forgotten).
3.  **YAML Venting**: A safe space to rant about why everything in modern computing eventually just becomes a giant, indented text file.

Thanks for stopping by. If you see me in a data center, a Slack thread, or deeply confused by a Python traceback, say hi!
